# JS Center of excellence

In this repo will be all my progress or process within CoE where I have been assigned a path to be able to increase my professional career

## About me 

I'm Sergio Expósito Martín my favorite area is Frontend because i like to create users experiences  because the user is the first thing they interact with and if the user has a good experience it can make a difference in the product.

I like to learn about my career because it is something that i am passionate about and i can contribute more to my professional projects. Currently i see Unosquare as a place where it can help me to be a better professional and person because i like his culture focused on its collaborators.

I love having goals and achieving them because that determines my personal and professional progress. because I think that the person should be measured and recognized for having achieved their goals.
